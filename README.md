## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used `@includes` from including styles from one class to another.

### Continued development

In the future I want not only use JS or JS frameworks, but I want to write tests for solutions. That would be great if I would use other stuff like GraphQL or Cypress.
